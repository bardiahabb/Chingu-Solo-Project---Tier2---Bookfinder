# Book Finder

## Overview

This project (Book Finder) is a part of journey through improving my product design skills. It's a Ties 2 solo project that needs to strat a Chingu journey. Go to [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) for more information. [Here](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier2-bookfinder) is also the link to project instruction github page.

In this project I used Nextjs as the JS framework to handle the job. The BookFinder consist of two main parts. The main search bar and the result cards. It uses Google Book API to search through book names and shows results as cards. Result Cards consist book's image, title, auther, publisher, and link to the more information.
